## NEGOTIATION STRATEGY:

- Asking Price: $34,900
- Comfortable Floor: $33,500 (your bottom line)
- Absolute Minimum: $32,500 (don't go below this)

Negotiation Points to Emphasize:
- $4,000+ in upgrades included (roof rack, tow hitch, tint, camping gear, mats, mud flaps)
- CPO warranty with 74k miles remaining
- Operating costs are $190/month versus $400+ for gas SUV = $2,500+/year in savings
- Hardware 4 is latest generation, future-proof for FSD
- Optional bike rack available for just $300 more (win-win add-on)

If buyer offers $32,000-32,500:
- Counter with $33,000 firm
- Offer to throw in bike rack for free (instead of $300) to close the deal
- This gives them $700 value (bike rack) and you get $33k


---

## EXPECTED TIMELINE:

- Days 1-3: 20-30 messages (mostly tire kickers asking "Is this available?")
- Days 4-7: 5-10 serious inquiries with real questions
- Days 8-14: 2-3 test drives scheduled
- Days 15-21: Likely sale between $33,000-$34,500

Be patient, the right buyer will come!
