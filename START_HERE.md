## 🏆 Analysis Results

### Top 3 Scenarios

**🥇 Keep Tesla 6mo** (Get Credits)
- Cost: $788/month for 6 months
- Then decide with $6k in pocket
- Best short-term play

**🥈 Sell → Toyota Tacoma** ($48k)
- Cost: $498/month (LOWEST)
- Best towing (6,500 lbs)
- Truck bed utility

**🥉 Sell → Toyota 4Runner** ($52k)
- Cost: $525/month
- Best balance of comfort + capability
- ⭐ **Our recommendation after waiting**

### Why 4Runner Wins

✅ Solves ALL your practical issues:
- Surfboards fit easily (89 cu ft cargo)
- Mountain bikes load without hassle
- Baja Mexico trips feasible (better than Tesla)
- Proven Toyota reliability
- Good legroom (important for hip problems)
- Strong resale value (59.7% retention)

❌ Trade-offs you accept:
- +$350/month fuel costs vs Tesla
- Lower tech than Tesla
- Not as quick/fun to drive

**Bottom Line**: You're not buying a car, you're buying your outdoor lifestyle back.

## 💰 Financial Reality Check

### Current Tesla (6 months)
```
Monthly cost: $265 (electricity, insurance, etc.)
Credits earned: +$6,000 (June 2026)
Net position: -$4,730
```

### After Switch to 4Runner (30 months)
```
Monthly cost: $672 (gas $417 + insurance + maintenance)
3-year position: -$18,901
```

### Total 3-Year Cost
```
6 months Tesla:  $4,730
30 months 4Runner: $18,901
────────────────────────
TOTAL: $23,631 over 36 months
= $657/month average
= $393/month premium over keeping Tesla
```

**Question**: Is $393/month worth it to get practical outdoor vehicle?

## 🤔 Common Questions

### "Why not sell now?"
You lose $2,524 by selling before collecting credits. Tesla depreciates $3,476 in 6 months, but you gain $6,000 in credits = net +$2,524.

### "Why not keep Tesla?"
If it works for you, great! But you mentioned:
- Limited cargo space
- Surfboard hassles
- Baja Mexico not feasible
- Need more practical outdoor vehicle

The data says these issues cost you more than $393/month in hassle/limitations.

### "Why not Tacoma instead?"
Valid choice! Tacoma is:
- $4k cheaper ($48k vs $52k)
- Better towing (6,500 lbs vs 5,000 lbs)
- Lower monthly cost ($498 vs $525)

But 4Runner has:
- Better rear legroom (important for hip problems)
- SUV comfort vs truck ride
- Enclosed cargo vs open bed

Test drive both. If rear legroom isn't critical, Tacoma saves money.

### "Why not Lexus GX?"
If budget allows, GX is amazing:
- Most cargo space (91 cu ft)
- Best comfort (9/10 vs 7/10)
- Luxury features

But costs $16k more ($68k vs $52k) and worst MPG (14/19). Only worth it if hip problems are severe and budget isn't tight.

### "Can I afford +$407/month?"
Operating costs go from $265/month (Tesla) to $672/month (4Runner).

If that's too much:
- Consider Tacoma (+$308/month instead)
- Or wait longer to save more
- Or keep Tesla and work around limitations

Only you know your budget comfort zone.
