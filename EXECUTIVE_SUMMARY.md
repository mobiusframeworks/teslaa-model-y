## Current Situation Analysis

### Your Tesla Model Y Reality Check

**What's Good:**
- Low operating costs ($0.04/mile electricity)
- Excellent legroom (41.8" front / 40.5" rear) - good for hip problems
- Strong AWD capability with 3,500 lbs towing
- Currently worth ~$30,450 trade-in value

**What's Not Working:**
- Limited cargo space (76 cu ft) - struggle with surfboards/bikes
- Not practical for Baja Mexico trips (charging infrastructure)
- High mileage causing steep depreciation ($400-600/month)
- Approaching 50k miles = end of warranty comfort zone
- Loses $15,736 in value over next 3 years at current pace

## Top 3 Replacement Scenarios

### 🥇 #1: Toyota 4Runner TRD Off-Road - $52k

**Why it's great for you:**
- **Cargo**: 89 cu ft (17% more than Tesla)
- **Legendary reliability**: Holds 59.7% value after 3 years
- **Outdoor capability**: 5,000 lbs towing, roof rack ready
- **Proven platform**: You already know you like it (2004 model)

**The trade-off:**
- Lower fuel economy: 16-19 MPG vs. Tesla's efficiency
- Operating costs: $25,800 over 3 years
- Total cost: $525/month vs. $788/month (Tesla 6mo)

**Net position after 36 months**: -$18,901

### 🥈 #2: Toyota Tacoma TRD Off-Road - $48k

**Why it's competitive:**
- **Best towing**: 6,500 lbs capacity (ideal for trailers)
- **Truck bed utility**: Better for bikes, gear loading
- **Value retention**: Toyota reliability legend
- **Lower entry cost**: $4k less than 4Runner

**The trade-off:**
- Less rear legroom (34.6") - might be issue for hip problems
- Truck ride quality - rougher than SUV
- Less enclosed cargo space (61 cu ft)

**Net position after 36 months**: -$17,921
**Monthly cost**: $498

### 🥉 #3: Lexus GX 550 Premium - $68k

**Why it's tempting:**
- **Maximum comfort**: 9.0/10 ride quality (Tesla: 7.5)
- **Best legroom**: 43.6" front / 38.4" rear
- **Most cargo**: 91 cu ft + luxury features
- **Serious capability**: 8,000 lbs towing, true off-road SUV

**The trade-off:**
- **Expensive**: $68k entry vs. $48-52k Toyotas
- Higher operating costs: Worst MPG (14/19)
- Monthly cost: $907 vs. $498 (Tacoma)

**Net position after 36 months**: -$32,649

---

## Scenarios to AVOID

### ❌ Dual Vehicle Ownership (Keep Tesla + Buy Truck)

**Cost**: $1,885/month (-$67,843 over 3 years)

**Why it's bad:**
- Storage costs eat you alive ($250/month)
- Double insurance, registration, maintenance
- Tesla continues depreciating while you don't use it
- Only makes sense if you NEED both (you don't)

### ❌ Luxury SUV + Premium Trailer Combos

**Example**: Lexus GX + Taxa Mantis = $2,507/month

**Why it's overkill:**
- Total cost: -$90,249 over 3 years
- Trailer depreciation adds $3,000/year
- Storage and complexity issues
- Your usage doesn't justify this expense

   - Are you ready for $1,600 insurance vs. $900?
   - Maintenance goes from $300/year to $660/year

3. **What matters most to you?**
   - Maximum capability → Get Tacoma + trailer
