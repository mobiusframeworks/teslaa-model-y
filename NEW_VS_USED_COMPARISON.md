## QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

**Q: Why not buy new for warranty?**
A: 2022 Tacoma at 30k miles still has 30k miles of powertrain warranty remaining. You're paying $9,000 for 30k miles of basic warranty coverage - not worth it.

**Q: Is 30k miles too many?**
A: For Toyota? No. Tacomas regularly go 200k+ miles. 30k is 15% of expected life.

**Q: What about depreciation on used?**
A: Used vehicles depreciate slower. New Tacoma loses 47% in 3 years. Used at 30k loses 34%. Better value retention.

**Q: Will I regret not getting new?**
A: Only if you deeply value new car smell and latest tech. Functionality-wise, they're identical.

**Q: What if I want more comfort than Tacoma?**
A: Used GX 460 offers Lexus luxury for only $13k more than used Tacoma. Still $16k less than new GX 550.

---

**Summary**: The math strongly favors **waiting to June + buying used Tacoma**. You maximize credits, minimize cost, and get essentially the same vehicle for $9,000 less.

*Analysis updated with correct credit structure*
*PG&E: $4,000 over 20 months = $200/mo*
*3CE: $2,000 at 12 months*
*Currently at month 7 = $1,400 earned*
*If kept to June (month 12) = $4,400 total*
