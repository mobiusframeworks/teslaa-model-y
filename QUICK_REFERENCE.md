## What NOT to Do

### ❌ Don't Keep Tesla + Buy Second Vehicle
- Cost: $1,885/month
- Storage: $250/month
- Not worth it for your usage pattern

### ❌ Don't Buy Expensive Trailer Combos
- Taxa Mantis: $45k adds $2,507/month total cost
- Better: Start simple, add trailer later if needed

### ❌ Don't Rush to Sell Before June
- Lose $2,524 by selling now vs waiting
- Unless you find amazing deal that offsets loss

### ❌ Don't Overbuy (Escalade, LX 600)
- Your needs don't justify $85k+ vehicles
- Extra depreciation doesn't add value
