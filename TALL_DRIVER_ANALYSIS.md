## Your Action Plan

1. **Keep driving Tesla** - Collect those credits
2. **Test drive in this order:**
   - Used 2022 Tacoma (your best value)
   - New 2024/2025 Tacoma (you said you fit better)
   - Tundra TRD Pro (max towing + comfort upgrade)
   - Sequoia TRD Pro (if budget allows)
   - Used GX 460 (luxury option)

3. **Check your fit** during test drives:
   - Sit for 15+ minutes
   - Adjust seat all the way back
   - Test legroom with shoes on
   - Drive on rough roads (test back comfort)
   - Check if you can sit comfortably upright

4. **Get quotes:**
   - Tesla trade-in value (Carvana, Vroom, dealers)
   - Insurance for target vehicles
   - Bay Area dealer pricing

### JUNE 2026 (Decision Time)

1. ✅ **Collect $4,400 in credits**
2. Get final Tesla trade-in quotes (~$27k expected)
3. Make purchase decision based on:
   - Which vehicle felt best during test drives
   - Best deal available
   - Budget comfort level

### RECOMMENDED CHOICE: Used 2022 Tacoma

**Why this wins for you:**
- ✅ **Fits your 6'3" frame** (42.9" legroom)
- ✅ **Best value**: Only $162/month over 36 months
- ✅ **You said you fit better in 2024+ models** - 2022 is new gen
- ✅ **Excellent towing**: 6,500 lbs
- ✅ **Toyota reliability**: Legendary
- ✅ **Still under warranty** if bought with low miles

**The compromise:**
- Ride is firmer (6.5/10 comfort) than Tesla (7.5/10)

- Back comfort depends on your specific needs

**Alternative if back pain is severe:** Used GX 460 (8.5/10 comfort) for $52k

## Questions to Ask Yourself

1. **How bad is your back issue?**
   - Mild discomfort → Used Tacoma $39k (6.5/10 comfort) = good enough
   - Moderate pain → Tundra $62k (7.5/10 comfort) = worth upgrade
   - Severe pain → Sequoia $72k (8.5/10 comfort) or GX 460 $52k = necessary

2. **Do you actually need max towing?**
   - 6,500 lbs (Tacoma) tows: Boats, small campers, ATVs
   - 12,000 lbs (Tundra) tows: Large campers, heavy trailers
   - Most people overestimate towing needs

3. **Truck bed vs enclosed cargo?**
   - Tacoma/Tundra = open bed (need tonneau cover for security)
   - Sequoia/GX = enclosed (easier to load bikes/boards)

4. **Can you afford the operating cost jump?**
   - Tesla: $265/month (electricity, insurance, maintenance)
   - Used Tacoma: $643/month (+$378 increase)
   - Tundra: $811/month (+$546 increase)
   - Sequoia: $970/month (+$705 increase)
